ODIN PROJECT: Landing Page

For this assignment, I am required to replicate a site layout linked on the lesson page within The Odin Project.  This will require use of flexbox for layouts and other CSS styling that has been reviewed so far in the course.

I have decided to use my own colors and font choices, as well as some original content.  I will collect royalty-free images on Unsplash to use for this page, as well as find/create a palette on Coolors to style the page.  I will also add fonts through Google.
